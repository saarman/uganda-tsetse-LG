# Contents of Analysis Scripts

Below is an annotated list of each major script/notebook in this project, in recommended execution order when applicable.

- **00_install_packages.R**  
   Installs all required R packages for the Uganda tsetse landscape‚Äêgenetics workflow.

- **01_PCA_diversity_CSE.Rmd**  
   Performs population genetic analysis and calculates connectivity (CSE) between site pairs.  
   - Uses PCA, diversity stats, and CSE metrics.  
   - Key packages: `adegenet`, `pegas`, `hierfstat`, `PopGenReport`, `poppr`, `ggplot2`, `sf`, `geosphere`, `igraph`, `vegan`, `ade4`, `viridis`.

- **02_prepare_rasters.R**  
   Prepares environmental raster layers for Uganda.  
   - Includes slope, elevation, river/lake kernel density, geographic distance.  
   - Key packages: `raster`, `terra`, `sf`, `KernSmooth`, `maps`, `units`, `future.apply`.

- **03_least-cost-lakes.Rmd**  
   Calculates least-cost paths between sites, avoiding lakes.  
   - Builds transition matrices and outputs path shapefiles.  
   - Key packages: `gdistance`, `raster`, `sp`, `sf`, `foreach`, `doParallel`, `future.apply`.

- **04_extract_envvar.Rmd**  
   Extracts mean, median, and mode values of environmental predictors along each least-cost path.  
   - Also computes cumulative geographic distance (in pixels).  
   - Key packages: `raster`, `sf`, `sp`, `doParallel`, `foreach`, `future.apply`.

- **05_RFmodel_full.Rmd**  
   Builds the main Random Forest model to predict genetic connectivity (CSE) using environmental predictors.  
   - Key packages: `randomForest`, `raster`, `sf`, `viridis`, `doParallel`.

- **06_LOPOCV_setup.R**  
   Prepares data and environment for the Leave-One-Point-Out Cross-Validation (LOPOCV) analysis.  
   - You must run this setup notebook before running central LOPOCV script

- **07_LOPOCV.R**  
   Performs the LOPOCV test on the Random Forest model.  
   - Depends on the objects and files generated by `LOPOCV_Setup.Rmd`; will not run correctly otherwise.

- **06_spatial_LOPOCV.R**  
   Conducts spatial validation on model outputs.  
   - Includes code to determine a maximum distance parameter accounting for the presence of Lake Victoria.

- **07_permutation_tests.R**  
   Perform permutation tests on RMSE and RSQ outputs.

- **08_visualize_results.Rmd**  
   Project and map model outputs, plot RSQ, etc.
