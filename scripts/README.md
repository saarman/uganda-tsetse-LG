# Contents of Analysis Scripts

Below is an annotated list of each major script/notebook in this project, in recommended execution order when applicable.

- **00_install_packages.R**  
   Installs all required R packages for the Uganda tsetse landscape‚Äêgenetics workflow.

- **01_PCA_diversity_CSE.Rmd**  
   Creates raster pixels for Lake Victoria, river kernel raster layer, geodist layer.
 
- **02_prepare_rasters.R**  
   Creates raster pixels for Lake Victoria, river kernel raster layer, geodist layer.
  
- **03_RFModel_full.Rmd**  
   Visually checks inputs. Builds the primary overall Random Forest connectivity model, explicitly including raster pixels for Lake Victoria.

- **04_LOPOCV_setup.R**  
   Prepares data and environment for the Leave-One-Point-Out Cross-Validation (LOPOCV) analysis.  
   - You must run this setup notebook before running `LOPOCV.Rmd`.

- **05_LOPOCV.R**  
   Performs the LOPOCV test on the Random Forest model.  
   - Depends on the objects and files generated by `LOPOCV_Setup.Rmd`; will not run correctly otherwise.

- **06_spatial_LOPOCV.R**  
   Conducts spatial validation on model outputs.  
   - Includes code to determine a maximum distance parameter accounting for the presence of Lake Victoria.

- **07_permutation_tests.R**  
   Perform permutation tests on RMSE and RSQ outputs.

- **08_visualize_results.Rmd**  
   Project and map model outputs, plot RSQ, etc.
